# **Blogging Platform**  
I built a **blogging platform** with full **CRUD operations** using **JSON Server as a mock backend**. The application allows users to **create, read, update, and delete blog posts seamlessly** while ensuring efficient state management and smooth navigation.  

## **Features**  
- **Create & Manage Blogs** – Users can add, edit, and delete blog posts effortlessly.  
- **Mock Backend (JSON Server)** – Simulates a real API, enabling seamless development.  
- **State Management with Easy-Peasy** – Efficiently manages application state.  
- **Navigation with React Router** – Enables smooth page transitions.  
- **Optimized API Calls with Axios** – Ensures fast and efficient data fetching.  

## **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Efficient State Handling** → Integrated **Easy-Peasy** to maintain a structured global state.  
- **Smooth API Calls** → Used **Axios** for optimized data fetching and CRUD operations.  
- **Seamless Navigation** → Implemented **React Router** for a better user experience.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **User Authentication** – Implement login and user-specific blog management.  
- **Comments & Likes** – Add engagement features for better interaction.  
- **Rich Text Editing** – Enhance the blog editor with formatting options.  
- **Database Integration** – Replace JSON Server with a real database like MySQL or Firebase.
